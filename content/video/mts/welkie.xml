<p begin="00:00:02.46" end="00:00:05.36">I&apos;m a senior in Pharmaceutical Marketing.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:05.36" end="00:00:09.35">My career ambitions are to combine my love of health care -</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:09.35" end="00:00:14.06">I have a degree in Respiratory Therapy and I stayed home to raise the family for 15 years.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:14.06" end="00:00:17.64">And I didn&apos;t want get back into that clinical health care.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:17.64" end="00:00:19.60">So I wanted something fresh and new.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:19.60" end="00:00:23.14">I combined the love of health care with my interest in Marketing,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:23.14" end="00:00:25.03">Event Planning, and Fund Raising.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:25.03" end="00:00:27.44">And I saw this-it was brand new.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:27.44" end="00:00:31.18">I was just reading the paper one day and I saw a brand new major,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:31.18" end="00:00:33.42">and it just screamed out my name.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:33.42" end="00:00:35.96">And I said, &quot;This is for me.&quot;</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:35.96" end="00:00:39.12">And so I jumped in and I&apos;ve just loved every minute of it.</p>
