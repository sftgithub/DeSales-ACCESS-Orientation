<p begin="00:00:00.15" end="00:00:01.44">My name is Simone Phillips.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:01.44" end="00:00:03.91">I am originally from South America.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:03.91" end="00:00:06.67">I moved to America 22 years ago.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:06.67" end="00:00:08.84">I&apos;m from a very large family.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:08.84" end="00:00:13.84">In that family, education is a very big priority.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:13.84" end="00:00:18.11">It is one of the things we pride ourselves on.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:18.11" end="00:00:20.95">Hence, I am continuing my education.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:20.95" end="00:00:26.51">I am a single mom; I have two daughters who I hope one day will attend DeSales.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:26.51" end="00:00:28.84">I am registered nurse by profession.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:28.84" end="00:00:34.94">I graduated from St. Luke&apos;s School of Nursing in Bethlehem.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:34.94" end="00:00:42.37">As I worked in the field, I discovered that I had a passion for therapeutic relationships.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:42.37" end="00:00:47.31">I really wanted to be a part of helping people solve life&apos;s issues,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:47.31" end="00:00:52.96">because we all encounter life&apos;s vicissitudes, and they affect us all in different ways.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:52.96" end="00:00:54.73">Sometimes you just need someone to listen.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:54.73" end="00:01:00.94">I found, given feedback, that I&apos;m very good at that.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:00.94" end="00:01:04.75">It&apos;s not just that I&apos;m good at it; I have a passion for it.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:04.75" end="00:01:08.45">So I thought I&apos;d come to DeSales be credentialed as the reputation</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:08.45" end="00:01:13.35">of DeSales was heralded among some of the circles that I move in.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:13.35" end="00:01:19.57">I have quite a few friends who are alumni, and a mentor who is an alumni of DeSales.</p>
