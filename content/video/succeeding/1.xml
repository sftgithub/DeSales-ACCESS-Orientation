<p begin="00:00:03.93" end="00:00:06.21">and Thought here at DeSales University.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:06.21" end="00:00:09.04">Today I&apos;d like to take a moment just to tell you the importance</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:09.04" end="00:00:12.41">of taking Communication and Thought here at DeSales.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:12.41" end="00:00:17.34">Having a voice in your college career is extremely important.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:17.34" end="00:00:20.94">It&apos;s time for you to join in the conversation in your specific discipline</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:20.94" end="00:00:23.82">and your professors want to see that you are actually engaging</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:23.82" end="00:00:30.34">with text that&apos;s put before you and how you analyze data that they give you.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:30.34" end="00:00:34.38">The way that you actually join into the conversation and show your professors</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:34.38" end="00:00:36.38">that you are learning is through writing.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:36.38" end="00:00:41.29">Clear and cogent writing is the backbone of becoming a successful student and beyond.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:41.29" end="00:00:46.32">In a recent article in the Chronical Heartford research association asked employers what</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:46.32" end="00:00:48.85">they&apos;re looking for from college graduates.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:48.85" end="00:00:54.26">89% said clear writing skills and 81% said critical thinking.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:54.26" end="00:00:58.13">Taking EN103 and EN104 Communication and Thought here</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:58.13" end="00:01:03.15">at DeSales University is extremely important and I encourage you to do it at the beginning</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:03.15" end="00:01:07.24">of your ACCESS career so that you can get the foundation that you need.</p>
