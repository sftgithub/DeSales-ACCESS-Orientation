<p begin="00:00:03.04" end="00:00:08.20">The biggest advice is to be just to take that first class.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:08.20" end="00:00:13.58">That first class is a big hurdle for a lto of people, especially for non-traditional students</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:13.58" end="00:00:19.29">that haven&apos;t been in school for awhile but you have to remember that you&apos;re not in it alone.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:19.29" end="00:00:23.00">You&apos;re going to meet a lot of great people from diverse backgrounds.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:23.00" end="00:00:25.64">But they&apos;re all there for the same reason-they want to learn.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:25.64" end="00:00:27.64">They want to finish something that they started.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:27.64" end="00:00:32.12">And you will get the support here that you&apos;re going to need.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:32.12" end="00:00:33.04">And don&apos;t be afraid.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:33.04" end="00:00:37.44">Just jump in with both feet and take a class and I think you&apos;ll be happy that you did.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:37.44" end="00:00:40.75">Jump in with both feet and take a class and I think you&apos;ll be happy that you did.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:40.75" end="00:00:47.17">The majority of instructors have gone to school part time nights in order to get where they are.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:47.17" end="00:00:52.41">So they understand that the students are not only going</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:52.41" end="00:00:53.82">to school but they&apos;re working full time.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:53.82" end="00:00:54.64">They have families.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:54.64" end="00:00:57.16">They have lives outside of that.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:57.16" end="00:00:58.55">I&apos;ve never had any issues.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:58.55" end="00:01:02.37">I&apos;ve always spoken to mu instructors beforehand if I needed any vacation.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:02.37" end="00:01:04.77">The first thing you need to do is to evaluate.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:04.77" end="00:01:07.73">And then once you have had all the things lined up.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:07.73" end="00:01:09.38">I mean, it&apos;s not going to be perfect.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:09.38" end="00:01:14.45">Sometimes as older students especially we want to wait for the children to be gone</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:14.45" end="00:01:18.51">and for the children to be in college, and for the house to be half paid for.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:18.51" end="00:01:22.08">And there&apos;s never a perfect time, but there&apos;s a workable time.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:22.08" end="00:01:26.45">And then when you see that picture you&apos;ve made those choices to live your life</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:26.45" end="00:01:29.83">into that picture and then commit, commit, and just do it.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:29.83" end="00:01:31.53">Just get it done.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:31.53" end="00:01:34.22">It will be over faster than you think.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:34.22" end="00:01:35.90">I don&apos;t know where the last 3 years went.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:35.90" end="00:01:37.43">It was pretty quick.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:37.43" end="00:01:39.39">It seems like it&apos;s going to take forever to finish your degree,</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:39.39" end="00:01:44.11">but the longer you stall off getting started, the longer it is before you get finished.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:44.11" end="00:01:48.99">But don&apos;t be afraid some classes that you might not necessarily think are that important</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:48.99" end="00:01:52.76">to you -- so the ones that are required for some of the Gen Ed credits.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:52.76" end="00:01:53.77">Western Civ.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:53.77" end="00:01:57.08">was one of the ones that I had to have.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:57.08" end="00:02:00.67">And after I took the first one I couldn&apos;t wait to take the second one.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:00.67" end="00:02:02.56">Really take it seriously.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:02.56" end="00:02:04.65">Be open to the teachers.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:04.65" end="00:02:06.81">Be open to new ideas.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:06.81" end="00:02:11.67">To be interested in learning and not just interested in getting that diploma.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:11.67" end="00:02:15.12">Really to appreciate the experience while they&apos;re here.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:15.12" end="00:02:20.54">I know a lot of students, adult students, come because maybe they have to for their job</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:20.54" end="00:02:24.71">or they want to advance in their career--which is great, it&apos;s a great thing to do.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:24.71" end="00:02:28.97">But while you&apos;re here, really enjoy the moment and the learning,</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:28.97" end="00:02:31.14">and not just look at the end result.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:31.14" end="00:02:33.89">Enjoy the time here and to really learn.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:33.89" end="00:02:34.65">Enjoy learning.</p>
