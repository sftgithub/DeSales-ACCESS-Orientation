<p begin="00:00:01.85" end="00:00:03.02">I&apos;m an ACCESS student.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:03.02" end="00:00:06.61">I&apos;m majoring in Theology with a minor in Philosophy.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:06.61" end="00:00:10.82">After running a business for 12 years the last thing I wanted to do was</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:10.82" end="00:00:12.98">to have anything to do with business.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:12.98" end="00:00:17.90">Actually a lot of the reason I wanted to get away from my business was</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:17.90" end="00:00:21.47">that I became more involved in theology and religion.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:21.47" end="00:00:23.98">So it came at the perfect time.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:23.98" end="00:00:28.28">Once my business stopped I found myself sitting in the ACCESS office.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:28.28" end="00:00:30.45">I really don&apos;t know how it happened.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:30.45" end="00:00:33.20">It just kind of happened --there I was and it was simple.</p>
     
<p begin="00:00:33.20" end="00:00:37.25">The next thing I knew within a month or so I was in the program.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:37.25" end="00:00:41.34">I&apos;m a sophomore now I&apos;ll be a junior in the winter.</p>
