<p begin="00:00:01.36" end="00:00:05.18">While it may sound simplistic...some of the most important reading you do</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:05.18" end="00:00:07.98">for a course will be reading the syllabus.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:07.98" end="00:00:12.65">That will serve as your guide...your road map...throughout the course.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:12.65" end="00:00:16.93">It may come as a surprise but many students don&apos;t read the syllabus and later find</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:16.93" end="00:00:20.61">out they missed a deadline or submitted something incorrectly.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:20.61" end="00:00:26.11">So, pay attention to and refer often to this very important document.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:26.11" end="00:00:30.35">First things first...read the textbook as assigned.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:30.35" end="00:00:35.35">Resist the temptation to rely on classroom discussions, PowerPoint presentations,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:35.35" end="00:00:38.93">and lecture notes as a means to understanding the material.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:38.93" end="00:00:42.60">Instructors use these methodologies to create a better understanding</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:42.60" end="00:00:46.13">of the material presented in the text.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:46.13" end="00:00:51.29">So you&apos;ve just taken that 386 page sociology textbook out of the wrapper.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:51.29" end="00:00:56.19">Now what? How can you make the most of your reading experience?</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:56.19" end="00:00:59.13">First, become familiar with the text.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:59.13" end="00:01:01.26">How are chapters arranged?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:01.26" end="00:01:05.76">Are key concepts and phrases highlighted or explained in margins?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:05.76" end="00:01:08.54">Is there a glossary contained within the text?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:08.54" end="00:01:11.90">Is there a review section at the end of each chapter?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:13.76" end="00:01:17.27">Prior to really reading a chapter, just glance through it.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:17.27" end="00:01:19.19">Again, how is it arranged?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:19.19" end="00:01:21.37">What major themes are covered?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:21.37" end="00:01:25.94">You&apos;re going to do the same thing when looking at paragraphs.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:25.94" end="00:01:28.69">What is the theme of the paragraph?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:28.69" end="00:01:30.92">Note any unfamiliar terms.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:30.92" end="00:01:33.73">If the text has a glossary, look them up.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:33.73" end="00:01:35.14">No glossary?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:35.14" end="00:01:38.54">Take the time to use a dictionary or the internet.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:38.54" end="00:01:44.73">Pay attention to examples, but know there is a difference between concepts and examples.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:44.73" end="00:01:47.86">Examples are offered to demonstrate concepts.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:47.86" end="00:01:50.28">Try to think of additional examples.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:50.28" end="00:01:53.41">While knowing an example helps to understand the concept,</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:53.41" end="00:01:56.36">be certain you understand the concept itself.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:56.36" end="00:02:02.74">If you are having difficulty grasping material or you&apos;re simply tired of reading, step away.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:02.74" end="00:02:04.66">Do something else for awhile.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:04.66" end="00:02:11.62">Return later to the text rereading difficult material or picking up where you left off.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:11.62" end="00:02:16.60">Review key themes and concepts, which are usually identified by bolded text,</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:16.60" end="00:02:20.94">material set off in margins, or reviewed at the end of the chapter.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:20.94" end="00:02:23.10">Get your monies worth.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:23.10" end="00:02:27.52">Take advantage of any supplemental material made available by the publisher.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:27.52" end="00:02:29.79">Did a CD-ROM accompany the text?</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:29.79" end="00:02:31.24">A study guide?</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:31.24" end="00:02:34.41">Does the publisher offer a website for the text?</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:35.44" end="00:02:38.62">A number of reading strategies exist.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:38.62" end="00:02:44.00">A popular one, SQ3R, has been in use since the 1940s.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:44.00" end="00:02:51.93">Simply SQ3R stands for...survey, question, read, recite, review.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:51.93" end="00:02:55.07">First, as mentioned before, skim the chapter,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:55.07" end="00:02:58.85">not reading...just becoming<br/>familiar with major themes.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:58.85" end="00:03:01.95">Ask questions about the chapter.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:01.95" end="00:03:04.29">What am I looking to learn from the chapter?</p>
    <p begin="00:03:04.29" end="00:03:07.23">What does the chapter indicate it&apos;s about?</p>
    <p begin="00:03:07.23" end="00:03:11.41">Begin reading...concentrating<br/>and reflecting on sections.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:11.41" end="00:03:15.89">Don&apos;t read the entire chapter and then<br/>try to figure out what is was about.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:15.89" end="00:03:21.17">Recite or recall, aloud or in writing,<br/>key points/phrases from a section.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:21.17" end="00:03:23.79">Do this in your own words.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:23.79" end="00:03:27.18">After you have read the entire chapter, review.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:27.18" end="00:03:29.98">Try to recall the key points/phrases.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:29.98" end="00:03:34.36">Reread any chapters where key points were missed or somewhat fuzzy.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:34.36" end="00:03:39.92">You may want to recite the key points/phrases directly on to note cards for ongoing review</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:39.92" end="00:03:43.81">that is portable anywhere, anytime.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:43.81" end="00:03:46.95">Some people find it helpful to take notes while reading.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:46.95" end="00:03:52.69">Note taking, whether during reading or during a lecture, is an often under-appreciated skill.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:52.69" end="00:03:54.88">And, one that takes some practice.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:54.88" end="00:03:57.88">You&apos;ll find a method that works for you.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:57.88" end="00:04:02.65">One system, the Cornell Method of Note Taking, has gained some popularity.</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:02.65" end="00:04:06.94">Developed by a Cornell University professor, it serves to organize notes</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:06.94" end="00:04:09.72">and allows for reflection and review.</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:09.72" end="00:04:14.11">Templates are available on the internet to print this note taking paper.</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:14.11" end="00:04:16.15">Simply, in the large area you&apos;ll want</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:16.15" end="00:04:21.44">to write very brief notes noting main ideas of a text or lecture.</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:21.44" end="00:04:24.68">On the left-hand area, write questions or important words</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:24.68" end="00:04:28.27">that come to mind as you reread the notes.</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:28.27" end="00:04:32.84">A second step in the same area, is to answer (or recite) the questions</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:32.84" end="00:04:36.85">or discuss why noted words are important.</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:36.85" end="00:04:41.55">In the lower section, summarize and reflect on the material.</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:41.55" end="00:04:43.78">Review notes from time to time.</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:43.78" end="00:04:48.11">Keep in mind that left-hand area becomes a great place to study for an exam.</p>
    
<p begin="00:04:48.11" end="00:04:51.40">You have identified important words and have created questions.</p>
