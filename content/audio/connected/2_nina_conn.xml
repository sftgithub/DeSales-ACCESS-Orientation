<p begin="00:00:00.15" end="00:00:02.09">I did join the Facebook page.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:02.09" end="00:00:05.42">I love Facebook and I&apos;m always checking that; I&apos;m like a little kid.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:05.42" end="00:00:06.93">So that&apos;s one way.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:06.93" end="00:00:10.45">But the events they have on campus that people don&apos;t take advantage of-I went</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:10.45" end="00:00:14.26">to go see the Shroud of Turin, that presentation.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:14.26" end="00:00:18.63">I checked the webpage, that&apos;s how I find out what&apos;s happening.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:18.63" end="00:00:20.26">I just look at the calendar.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:20.26" end="00:00:23.69">Also, when you come to class, if you look on the bulletin boards,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:23.69" end="00:00:26.41">you&apos;re not going to find that stuff on ANGEL.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:26.41" end="00:00:30.82">If you have the interest, take a couple of minutes and check it out.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:30.82" end="00:00:32.92">I seriously suggest taking advantage of it</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:32.92" end="00:00:36.20">because the programs they offer here are fantastic, and they&apos;re free.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:36.20" end="00:00:38.39">Usually they&apos;re free to students.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:38.39" end="00:00:45.22">I think it&apos;s crazy not to-very educational, entertaining, it beats sitting in front</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:45.22" end="00:00:47.16">of the TV at night, it really does.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:47.16" end="00:00:49.26">It furthers your education and it&apos;s free.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:49.26" end="00:00:53.06">It makes you feel a part of the community here.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:53.06" end="00:00:54.00">It&apos;s so important.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:54.00" end="00:00:56.50">You don&apos;t want to feel like you&apos;re just coming here,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:56.50" end="00:00:58.99">getting the credits, getting the paper and moving on.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:58.99" end="00:01:00.99">You want it to be part of your life experience.</p>
