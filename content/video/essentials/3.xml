<p begin="00:00:00.46" end="00:00:01.50">Hi. I&apos;m Hollie Knauss.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:01.50" end="00:00:03.75">I&apos;m the Bursar here at DeSales University.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:03.75" end="00:00:08.50">I want to give you some information concerning when we do our billing for ACCESS students</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:08.50" end="00:00:11.84">and some options for payments and things like that that we have.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:11.84" end="00:00:13.95">We do our billing a session at a time.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:13.95" end="00:00:18.81">So for example, if you&apos;d be starting with the fall session, you&apos;d actually be billed</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:18.81" end="00:00:22.12">for that session about three weeks before the session would start.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:22.12" end="00:00:28.57">It would be due before the class actually begins if you&apos;re going to be making payments.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:28.57" end="00:00:31.07">We do have several options.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:31.07" end="00:00:35.16">You can pay online through your Web Advisory account by using the Make a Payment link.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:35.16" end="00:00:40.69">You can also pay by using some financial aid which would be a financial aid deferment</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:40.69" end="00:00:43.99">if you&apos;ve completed all your forms with the Financial Aid office.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:43.99" end="00:00:47.05">You can use that to cover the balance on your account,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:47.05" end="00:00:50.44">or a portion of the balance for your classes.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:50.44" end="00:00:54.01">You do need to take six credits to be eligible for financial aid.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:54.01" end="00:00:58.58">So that would be a combination of either session one six credits, or sessions one</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:58.58" end="00:01:02.36">and two six credits combined between those.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:02.36" end="00:01:07.69">Or you can also include the mid semester (or mini semester) that is offered as well.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:07.69" end="00:01:12.65">We do a tuition deferment or company deferment as well.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:12.65" end="00:01:16.19">We would need a copy of your policy from your company,</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:16.19" end="00:01:19.98">or a letter indicating what their policy is for reimbursement.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:19.98" end="00:01:24.92">At that point you would not need to make payment for the course once we have that information.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:24.92" end="00:01:33.44">WE would end up then billing you for that course 8 weeks after the session ends for that course.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:33.44" end="00:01:40.65">So you would be sending that grade and your paperwork into your employer</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:40.65" end="00:01:43.06">and payment would be due after the session ends.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:43.06" end="00:01:48.37">As an example, if you take a Session 1 class and you use company deferment, you would need to pay</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:48.37" end="00:01:51.66">for that class by the beginning of Session 3.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:51.66" end="00:01:55.04">So we do skip an eight-week session in there so that you can have time</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:55.04" end="00:01:58.06">to submit your grade and your paperwork.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:58.06" end="00:02:01.59">We also do have payment plans that you&apos;re able to do.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:01.59" end="00:02:05.58">The payment plan that we do is a Three Payment payment plan for a session.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:05.58" end="00:02:08.14">You would make the first payment before the class starts.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:08.14" end="00:02:12.03">The second payment is due halfway through the class-four weeks into the class.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:12.03" end="00:02:16.68">The last payment is due before the course ends and that session ends.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:16.68" end="00:02:21.63">For the day students, we do actually take payments over the entire semester.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:21.63" end="00:02:25.41">So if you are taking a day class as well, you can take that and split it</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:25.41" end="00:02:29.09">up over the five months that you&apos;re attending classes.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:29.09" end="00:02:33.32">Our Bursar&apos;s Office is located on the second floor of Dooling Hall.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:33.32" end="00:02:39.39">There are two places you can go-either the Bursar&apos;s Office window or the Bursar&apos;s Office.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:39.39" end="00:02:46.17">Our main contact is Joann Seif and you can reach her in the Bursar&apos;s Office at the window.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:46.17" end="00:02:51.28">Our hours are Monday - Thursday during the regular school year from 8:00 to 5:30.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:51.28" end="00:02:54.30">On Fridays, we are open from 8:00 to 5:00.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:54.30" end="00:02:58.25">During the summer, we are open from 8:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:58.25" end="00:02:59.70">You can give us phone call.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:59.70" end="00:03:02.07">We can always take questions that way.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:02.07" end="00:03:07.16">You can make payment with a credit card over the phone, or through WebAdvisor like I mentioned.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:07.16" end="00:03:10.75">If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:10.75" end="00:03:11.04">Thank you.</p>
