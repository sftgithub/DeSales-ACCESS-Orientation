<p begin="00:00:00.95" end="00:00:03.16">Anxiety is not a bad thing.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:03.16" end="00:00:06.70">Some level of anxiety helps to boost performance.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:06.70" end="00:00:11.92">It&apos;s when anxiety interferes with the ability to function that it needs to be addressed.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:11.92" end="00:00:16.94">And, we all know how that feels: an overwhelming sense of dread, a rapid heartbeat,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:16.94" end="00:00:20.47">excessive perspiration, inability to focus.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:20.47" end="00:00:25.91">Students often complain of anxiety at the thought of taking exams...test anxiety.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:25.91" end="00:00:29.02">That&apos;s not a good time to experience an inability to focus</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:29.02" end="00:00:31.86">or an overwhelming sense of dread.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:31.86" end="00:00:34.91">So, how do we overcome test anxiety?</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:34.91" end="00:00:38.59">Honestly, overcoming is probably not the right word.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:38.59" end="00:00:42.36">Managing is probably a more realistic expectation.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:42.36" end="00:00:45.87">And, since it does enhance performance, maintaining some level</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:45.87" end="00:00:49.73">of anxiety is actually beneficial.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:49.73" end="00:00:53.80">A major step to managing test anxiety is through preparation.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:53.80" end="00:00:58.59">If you&apos;re prepared for an exam, you&apos;re less likely to stress over it.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:58.59" end="00:01:01.67">Preparation takes place throughout the session or semester</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:01.67" end="00:01:04.97">and culminates with a review of the material.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:04.97" end="00:01:07.45">It does not mean cramming for an exam.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:07.45" end="00:01:09.06">Cramming doesn&apos;t work.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:09.06" end="00:01:12.01">It often takes away from time spent resting or eating,</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:12.01" end="00:01:15.62">two things that aid in optimum performance.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:15.62" end="00:01:19.72">Get plenty of sleep the evening before an exam and make certain you&apos;ve eaten,</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:19.72" end="00:01:23.03">at least a snack, before the exam.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:23.03" end="00:01:28.46">When sitting for the exam, don&apos;t start the exam until you&apos;ve carefully read the directions.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:28.46" end="00:01:32.86">It would a terrible waste of time and brain power if you answered all of the essay questions</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:32.86" end="00:01:36.16">when the directions said to choose only one.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:36.16" end="00:01:39.59">Wasting time is something you definitely don&apos;t want to do.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:39.59" end="00:01:44.13">If you don&apos;t know the answer to a question, skip that one to return to later.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:44.13" end="00:01:47.82">Something in the rest of the exam may help answer that question.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:47.82" end="00:01:50.85">And dwelling on a question too long creates frustration,</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:50.85" end="00:01:53.61">which can make you feel more anxious.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:53.61" end="00:01:57.66">A good way to stay focused on essay questions is to write a quick outline.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:57.66" end="00:02:02.82">This will get theories, concepts, etc. on paper allowing you to focus on the writing</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:02.82" end="00:02:07.06">and assuring that you won&apos;t forget a point while putting together the essay response.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:07.06" end="00:02:08.62">Pay attention to your writing.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:08.62" end="00:02:11.03">Keep it concise.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:11.03" end="00:02:15.03">It&apos;s true...first responses are usually correct.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:15.03" end="00:02:17.27">Try not to second guess yourself.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:17.27" end="00:02:21.19">If you are really torn between answers, select the one you believe to be best</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:21.19" end="00:02:25.06">or answer the question to the best of your ability at that point.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:25.06" end="00:02:29.07">Put a question mark in the margin and return to it later, time permitting.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:29.07" end="00:02:30.72">Don&apos;t read into questions.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:30.72" end="00:02:32.53">Take them at face value.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:32.53" end="00:02:36.61">Don&apos;t start saying things like, &quot;True...but.&quot;</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:36.61" end="00:02:40.36">After going through the exam, time permitting...return to the items</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:40.36" end="00:02:42.55">with question marks in the margin.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:42.55" end="00:02:47.25">Don&apos;t spend too much time...make changes for anything you feel strongly about.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:47.25" end="00:02:50.17">Just remember the first response adage.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:50.17" end="00:02:52.68">Now go to those questions you didn&apos;t answer.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:52.68" end="00:02:55.06">Do your best to select an answer.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:55.06" end="00:03:00.73">Unless otherwise noted, any answer...in that situation...will be better than no answer.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:00.73" end="00:03:02.26">Still have time?</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:02.26" end="00:03:04.05">Double check your work.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:04.05" end="00:03:06.88">If you have used a &quot;bubble sheet&quot; for your responses,</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:06.88" end="00:03:09.85">try to make certain you&apos;ve placed the answers in the correct spaces</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:09.85" end="00:03:15.04">and that you aren&apos;t one question off as that will make all subsequent answers incorrect.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:15.04" end="00:03:18.47">Don&apos;t worry about who has finished the test and in how much time.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:18.47" end="00:03:20.91">Just because someone finishes an exam in what seems</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:20.91" end="00:03:24.19">to be record time doesn&apos;t mean they have aced the exam.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:24.19" end="00:03:26.51">It&apos;s just as likely they were clueless and raced</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:26.51" end="00:03:29.28">through the exam just to finish and leave the room.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:29.28" end="00:03:32.60">Finally, don&apos;t dwell on the exam after you leave the room.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:32.60" end="00:03:35.72">No racing to check your notes to see how you think you did.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:35.72" end="00:03:38.19">It&apos;s over and it&apos;s time to prepare for the next class.</p>
