<p begin="00:00:00.03" end="00:00:10.09">The tools that are offered, as far as ANGEL, WebAdvisor, email-all of that is fantastic.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:10.09" end="00:00:11.49">I&apos;ve used all of them.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:11.49" end="00:00:14.62">Computers are not something that adults should be afraid of anymore.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:14.62" end="00:00:17.20">Because they&apos;re all use friendly.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:17.20" end="00:00:20.54">It&apos;s like answering a question to the computer.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:20.54" end="00:00:21.43">It&apos;s very simple.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:21.43" end="00:00:23.72">Just click your way through it-- piece of cake.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:23.72" end="00:00:25.00">No problem.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:25.00" end="00:00:29.83">It makes communication great for adults who may be at work who want to jump</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:29.83" end="00:00:33.07">on the computer, maybe contact your professor.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:33.07" end="00:00:38.48">WebAdivsor is wonderful because, you can just sit at your computer wherever you are,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:38.48" end="00:00:41.94">schedule all your classes, see how you&apos;re doing.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:41.94" end="00:00:47.68">ANGEL is user friendly, just like everything else on the computer.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:47.68" end="00:00:50.34">It&apos;s simple, it&apos;s all self explanatory.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:50.34" end="00:00:53.73">If you can read and you can click, you can use ANGEL-- simple.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:53.73" end="00:00:57.74">I think for the ACCESS evening classes, ANGEL is extremely important,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:57.74" end="00:01:01.72">and that your professor will provide you with sort of a schedule</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:01.72" end="00:01:04.12">that will tell you how often you should check.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:04.12" end="00:01:05.03">Usually they do.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:05.03" end="00:01:07.42">And normally it&apos;s several times a week.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:07.42" end="00:01:12.31">You need ot put in a certain amount of hours on ANGEL and I think they can track that too,</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:12.31" end="00:01:15.33">I&apos;m pretty sure they can, which is great.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:15.33" end="00:01:20.72">You usually have to do the discussion boards and you will have to respond</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:20.72" end="00:01:23.85">to them-post a post and respond to posts.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:23.85" end="00:01:26.91">So, you&apos;re in and out of ANGEL a lot, definitely.</p>
