<p begin="00:00:00.04" end="00:00:02.36">Has anyone had to use the help desk?</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:02.36" end="00:00:06.94">What resources do you use as far as the technology basically?</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:06.94" end="00:00:12.44">For me, I just used the Help Desk initially when I started here,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:12.44" end="00:00:14.88">as far as setting up all of my accounts.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:14.88" end="00:00:16.98">They were very helpful in that regard.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:16.98" end="00:00:22.04">I actually enjoyed working with Angel.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:22.04" end="00:00:27.68">Especially for the online classes, being able to converse with everyone through Angel.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:27.68" end="00:00:34.42">I&apos;ve had professors that have actually videoed themselves, in class and online classes,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:34.42" end="00:00:38.78">and supplemented the PowerPoints so that way you could go back</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:38.78" end="00:00:46.73">and actually view your class you had attended in case you had any issues or your online classes</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:46.73" end="00:00:50.17">where they would put audio to the presentations.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:50.17" end="00:00:55.07">You would sit for an hour or so throughout<br/>the week at your convenience and just go</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:55.07" end="00:00:59.72">through your class for the week and then you&apos;d have your discussion board.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:59.72" end="00:01:06.38">So they&apos;re really taking advantage of the technology that&apos;s out there today.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:06.38" end="00:01:14.23">Because of the decrease in amount of tuition ACCESS students pay, you don&apos;t have access</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:14.23" end="00:01:17.04">to all the services that the traditional students do.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:17.04" end="00:01:18.89">But we do provide tutoring.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:18.89" end="00:01:22.64">I don&apos;t know if any of you have used it or taken advantage of it,</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:22.64" end="00:01:27.95">if you could talk a little bit about that.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:27.95" end="00:01:29.45">I used tutoring yesterday.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:29.45" end="00:01:30.29">I have used tutoring.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:30.29" end="00:01:37.30">Like you said, solely because of the difference in tuition, there&apos;s a little bit of a difference</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:37.30" end="00:01:39.68">in the access the ACCESS students have.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:39.68" end="00:01:46.76">Fortunately, I go by day and I have other situations that facilitate</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:46.76" end="00:01:50.21">and offer me the opportunity to use the tutoring services.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:50.21" end="00:01:55.50">I have to say though that I&apos;ve had all professional tutors, they&apos;re excellent,</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:55.50" end="00:02:00.66">Besides that, sometimes I think that because we don&apos;t have access</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:00.66" end="00:02:04.08">to certain services, we don&apos;t stop and ask questions.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:04.08" end="00:02:09.65">I have to say the staff, even if you&apos;re not necessarily entitled to those services,</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:09.65" end="00:02:11.96">will stop and answer questions for you.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:11.96" end="00:02:15.86">And they say, &quot;Hey, I can&apos;t really tutor you, but what is it you&apos;re working on?&quot;</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:15.86" end="00:02:19.41">That is really important in that department.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:19.41" end="00:02:22.94">However, you do have to be proactive on your own behalf.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:22.94" end="00:02:24.19">Seek that out.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:24.19" end="00:02:25.70">Because they can&apos;t read your mind.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:25.70" end="00:02:29.33">They can&apos;t always know what your needs are-you don&apos;t really come with a sign or anything.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:29.33" end="00:02:34.34">So, I have had occasions when, even though the person wasn&apos;t my tutor, I&apos;d say,</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:34.34" end="00:02:36.57">&quot;Can you read this and tell me if I had it right?&quot;</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:36.57" end="00:02:38.95">And I&apos;d go correct it and turn it in.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:38.95" end="00:02:40.95">The tutoring service is really excellent there.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:40.95" end="00:02:41.89">That&apos;s good advice.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:41.89" end="00:02:44.91">How about the library.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:44.91" end="00:02:48.97">Do people use the library these days?</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:48.97" end="00:02:51.13">I live in the library!</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:51.13" end="00:02:52.39">I love the library.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:52.39" end="00:02:55.70">It&apos;s just a great place.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:55.70" end="00:02:59.41">The atmosphere there.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:59.41" end="00:02:59.79">Everything.</p>
    
<p begin="00:02:59.79" end="00:03:00.77">The people there are great.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:00.77" end="00:03:03.18">The resources are phenomenal.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:03.18" end="00:03:05.36">I love the library.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:05.36" end="00:03:12.05">If I&apos;m a returning student and I haven&apos;t written a paper for 25 years, could I go to someone</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:12.05" end="00:03:16.48">in the library, and would they take time to help me?</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:16.48" end="00:03:17.13">Absolutely.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:17.13" end="00:03:17.61">That&apos;s what they do.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:17.61" end="00:03:20.77">I think there are signs on the door telling you that.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:20.77" end="00:03:22.78">I think there are signs on the counter when you go in.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:22.78" end="00:03:24.52">They want to help.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:24.52" end="00:03:25.32">They want to help.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:25.32" end="00:03:26.52">They really do.</p>
    
<p begin="00:03:26.52" end="00:03:27.53">They&apos;re great over there.</p>
