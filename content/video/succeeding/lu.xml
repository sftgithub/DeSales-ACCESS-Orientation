<p begin="00:00:01.39" end="00:00:05.41">Listening is so important and is different from merely hearing.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:05.41" end="00:00:10.66">Hearing is linked to anatomy and physiology while listening is linked to concentration.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:10.66" end="00:00:14.30">How many times have you heard someone speaking and followed it up with</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:14.30" end="00:00:18.46">&quot;what did you say?&quot;Whether it be in conversation with loved ones,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:18.46" end="00:00:21.26">in a meeting on the job, or in the classroom...</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:21.26" end="00:00:25.37">listening is a skill that is developed and honed much like any other.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:25.37" end="00:00:32.04">And, like other skills, some find it comes naturally, while others have to make an effort.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:32.04" end="00:00:34.98">How do you improve your listening skills?</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:34.98" end="00:00:38.28">First, tune in...pay attention.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:38.28" end="00:00:41.90">Distractions are easy and, sometimes, welcome.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:41.90" end="00:00:44.12">Fight the urge to become distracted.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:44.12" end="00:00:46.28">Stay focused on the speaker.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:46.28" end="00:00:46.92">Be active.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:46.92" end="00:00:50.07">Ask questions.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:50.07" end="00:00:53.26">Listen thoughtfully to the responses.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:53.26" end="00:00:59.30">Review what you have heard immediately and later, after some time has passed.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:59.30" end="00:01:04.27">Another skill required for success in the classroom is note taking during a lecture.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:04.27" end="00:01:06.91">Listening is critical to good note taking.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:06.91" end="00:01:09.88">The listening required here is a little different.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:09.88" end="00:01:14.12">In addition to the content, you&apos;ll need to be aware of some other things.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:14.12" end="00:01:17.10">Pay attention to cues.</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:17.10" end="00:01:19.00">Did the speaker get louder?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:19.00" end="00:01:22.81">Did she take a few steps forward...maybe stand a bit straighter?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:22.81" end="00:01:27.63">Did she take time to write something on the whiteboard or use the laser pointer?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:27.63" end="00:01:30.48">How often did she repeat the same phrase?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:30.48" end="00:01:33.97">Did she restate the same thing two or three different ways?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:33.97" end="00:01:38.93">And, how much time was spent on a particular topic...just a passing mention</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:38.93" end="00:01:41.87">or did significant discussion take place?</p>
    
<p begin="00:01:41.87" end="00:01:45.62">These are all things that indicate something important was said.</p>
