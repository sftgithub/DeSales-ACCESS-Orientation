<p begin="00:00:05.44" end="00:00:09.04">The newest mail&apos;s up there with the newest happenings around campus.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:09.04" end="00:00:11.49">I love how the pictures change every day.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:11.49" end="00:00:12.92">You never see the same old picture.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:12.92" end="00:00:18.75">You see some other pretty part of campus-maybe a statue or just some rolling pastures,</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:18.75" end="00:00:21.70">and then student faces is always nice.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:21.70" end="00:00:28.00">So I find everything that I need to know-special events at Christmastime, concerts and things.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:28.00" end="00:00:30.40">It&apos;s all there, and it&apos;s very inclusive.</p>
    
<p begin="00:00:30.40" end="00:00:33.31">So I&apos;ve benefited from having that resource.</p>
